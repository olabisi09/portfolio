This project was all about empowering businesses to manage their financial operations efficiently. The platform offered features for merchants to:

- Generate and send payment links to customers for hassle-free payments.
- Keep track of payouts with detailed insights.
- Manage wallets seamlessly for quick access to funds.

### The Highlight: Mandate for Recurring Transactions
I worked on the mandate feature, a game-changer for businesses wanting to automate recurring payments with their customers. This feature ensured that businesses could set up recurring payment schedules effortlessly, saving time and reducing manual invoicing.

### What I Did:
My focus was on creating a clean, user-friendly interface that merchants could rely on daily. Using React and TypeScript, I developed a smooth flow for setting up mandates, ensuring users could manage recurring transactions with just a few clicks. I also leveraged Material UI to maintain a sleek and professional design across the platform.
This project taught me a lot about building scalable features for high-transaction environments while keeping the user experience at the forefront. It was exciting to contribute to a tool that makes running a business simpler and more efficient.
