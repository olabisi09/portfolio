For this project, I built and maintained a robust membership portal that streamlined key activities for HR professionals. The portal allowed members to:

- Pay annual subscriptions and conference fees effortlessly.
- Apply for and receive membership licenses, with an automated approval process tailored to different user roles.
- Upgrade membership levels based on their career progression.
- The platform featured role-based access control to ensure secure and personalized experiences for various user types.

### What I Did:
I led the front-end development, implementing an intuitive and responsive user interface using React and TypeScript. I also managed state efficiently with Jotai, ensuring smooth interactions and dynamic updates across the platform.

This project helped optimize workflows for thousands of HR professionals and significantly reduced manual processes for the organization.
